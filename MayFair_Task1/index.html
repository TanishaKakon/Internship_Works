                  Do you dread having to look up, down, or to one side because
                  of the pain you know youâ€™ll experience? Do you struggle for

                  neck? Has your neck never been the same since that scary car
                  crash or sports accident? Neck pain can make ordinary actions
                  and tasks a major chore, ruining your quality of life.

                  Do you wince when you reach overhead, slip on a T-shirt, or
                  roll over on your shoulder at night? If so, you probably know
                  firsthand how debilitating and frustrating a shoulder pain
                  condition can be. Whether you injured your shoulder in a
                  recent accident, strained your shoulder by over-training, or
                  simply are dealing with age-related shoulder joint
                  dysfunction, you may find yourself struggling with day to day
                  functions which you might have once taken for granted.

                  Your hips and knees experience the brute force of your bodyâ€™s

                  Hips and knee injuries are particularly difficult to recover
                  from because providing these parts of your body with the rest

                  When youâ€™re at work there are often strict deadlines that have
                  to be met and sometimes even more work than can be
                  accomplished within the required time frame. This means people
                  may rush, causing accidents to happen. When you combine too
                  many repetitive motions with hectic schedules and the desire
                  to prove yourself, it is a recipe for injury. There are
                  several other specific causes of work-related injuries.
                  Tripping, slipping, and falling often lead to injuries on the
                  job. Sometimes distractions or overexertion will play a role
                  in injuries as well.<br />
